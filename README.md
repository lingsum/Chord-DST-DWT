# Chord-DST-DWT
Project: The Performance of  DST-Wavelet Feature Extraction for Guitar Chord Recognition.
Software: Python.
Dataset: The dataset is a primary data. It comprises two-second signal data captured in WAV format, encompassing seven guitar chords (C, D, E, F, G, A, and B). Upon visually inspecting the signal data, it was found that a two-second recording adequately captures the steady-state portion of the signal, where the chord information predominantly resides. The recordings were conducted at a sampling frequency of 5 kHz, adhering to Shannon's sampling theorem, which stipulates that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal. In this context, upon visually inspecting the signal spectrum, the highest frequency component is 392 Hz. This highest frequency component is corresponding to the G4 note, a subset of the G chord. The recordings were also conducted using a Yamaha CPX-500-II guitar in a quiet environment. A one-channel recording was used, since the spatial information of the signal is unnecessary.
